1) The only thing that has changed between parts 1-3 and part 4 is
   that keywords (such as WHILE, IF, BREAK, etc.) now have their own
   separate tokens rather than being part of the ID token. RELOP was also
   renamed to COMPARE

2) How to run:
%   make
%   ./lexer input.c--

3) The test output is in ...lexer/typescript
4) The test used was ...test_suite/testsometokens.c--
